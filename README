Holy shit, why do people always have these.

Hokay, so I'm gonna make a calculator for FFXI items because there aren't enough people out there sperging about MMOs.

Big thank you to the folks at FFXIAH.com for having a publically accessible xml file with item names & docs.
You can grab the xml file at http://www.ffxiah.com/dev
